Since our focus is not specifically on learning R, but rather on interpreting and understanding results, you may make use of online resources for coding examples unless I explicitly tell you not to use something. You do need to explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nThis policy includes the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as Chat GPI. You should be mindful, however, of the following guiding principles for using AI in this course:1\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a coding resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the stated due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances, I will not accept work after those dates."

Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. We will consider why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nYou will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. You will acquire a conceptual understanding and proficiency in statistical and quantitative reasoning tools to help you critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.\nMTH 161, Elementary Statistics, provides students with an introduction to the methods and concepts involved in working with data and non-deterministic situations. In this class, you will:\n\nexposed to the conceptual structure of statistics and its underpinnings in discrete and continuous probability theory.\nexposed to the pervasive use of statistics in other disciplines.\nexposed to the uses and misuses of statistical inference (e.g. hypothesis tests) in technical journals and the popular press.\nintroduced to concepts in statistical inference, such as the importance of randomized design, how to collect good data, how to analyze the data, and how to carry out and properly interpret the results of hypothesis tests.\ndevelop skills in using computer software to do statistical analysis and inference.\n\nUpon completion of the course you can expect to be conversant in the rudiments of data analysis, probability, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression. At the end of the semester, a successful student will be able to say they can:\n\nPerform an exploratory analysis of univariate and bivariate data.\nSummarize data graphically using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, etc.\nSummarize data numerically using measures of central tendency and variation.\nRecognize a properly defined probability distribution function.\nCalculate the probabilities of events in a sample space.\nArticulate the concept of a random variable.\nCalculate probabilities associated with basic types of random variables.\nArticulate the Central Limit Theorem.\nCompute and interpret confidence intervals.\nArticulate the underlying reasons for steps in hypothesis testing.\nSetup, conduct and interpret a hypothesis test.\nCalculate and interpret the least-squares regression line correlation coefficient from bivariate data."

    "text": "Visualization\nAn important tool in understanding and analyzing data is visualization. For example, we can use a scatterplot to help us understand relationships between variables. Let’s look at a scatterpolot that compares body mass and flipper length.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, \n       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point()\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nWhat does each point on the graph represent?\nBased on this scatterplot, how would you describe the relationship between these two variables?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Explanation\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code above, there are three main elements that go into producing our scatter plot:\n\nThe first element to the ggplot command identifies the data frame – in this case penguins\nThe second element is the mapping which specifies how the variables are going to show up in the graph – in this case, the x and y axes are going to come from the flipper length and body mass respectively.\nThe last element specifies the geom which determines how the data is represented – since we want a scatterplot, our geometric objects are points, hence geom_point()\n\nBefore we add more layers to this plot, let’s pause for a moment and review the warning message we got:\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range (geom_point())\n\nWe’re seeing this message because there are two penguins in our dataset with missing body mass and/or flipper length values and ggplot2 has no way of representing them on the plot without both of these values. Like R, ggplot2 subscribes to the philosophy that missing values should never silently go missing.\n\n\n\nR gives us the ability to modify and customize our visualizations a great deal – indeed this is one of the main strengths of R. This is not a course in learning R, so we won’t go through these code chunks in great detail, but it’s helpful to have a basic understanding of what’s going on.\nLet’s modify our visualization!"

We will see later in Chapter 7 how to quantify this observation in a precise way but for the time being, let’s add one more feature to our graph. As we know, there are three different species of penguins in our data set – but our scatter plot does not show this! We can easily adust how our geom appears by specifying that the color of the point should be determined by some other variable – i.e species.\n\nggplot(\n  data = penguins,\n  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +\n  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species))\n\nWarning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\n\n\n\nHow does the addition of coloring by species change your understanding of this graph?\nWhat additional questions about this data can you come up with?\n\n\n\nIt’s good practice to not rely on color alone to distinguish the points. People may perceive colors differently due to color blindness or other color vision differences and different devices might display colors in unexpected ways.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry it!\n\n\n\nModify your mapping of the points to include shape by adding shape = species to the aes mapping for the points.

You will acquire a conceptual understanding and proficiency in statistical and quantitative reasoning tools to help you critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.",

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive.\nPlease update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta101-f23.github.io.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Slack. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Slack before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Slack, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

Attendance will not be taken during class but you are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.\nIf you have a laptop or table, you may find it helpful to bring it to class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

If you do need to miss class for any reason, you can check the class Moodle page to see what we covered. I will also post all slides.\n\n\nInteractive tutorials\nYou will be assigned a number of interactive tutorials each week from the textbook. You will be asked to submit these on a weekly basis and graded on a check/no check basis.\nMake sure to add your name and your Net ID before generating the hash. Submit these in Canvas.\nIf you’ve completed at least 80% of the tutorials, you’ll get all available points for this component.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in class to various data analysis scenarios. Labs will focus on both computation and conceptualization. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto and submitted as PDF for feedback. While you may collaborate with others on lab assignments, you will need to submit your own final lab report.\n\n\nQuizzes\nWe will have occasional short in-class quizzes. The purpose of these is to check-in where you are in your understanding of various concepts throughout the semester.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be a mid-semester prediction project and a final project. The prediction project will introduce you to conducting independent analyses and writing a formal report using a pre-specified data set. The final project allows you to explore a question and data set of your own. More details about the projects will be provided during the semester. Projects will be completed in teams.\nYou will be assigned to a different team for each of your two projects. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.\nSee Section 11 for dates and times of project deadlines. Project deadlines cannot be changed. If you can’t be in class for the final project presentation, you should drop this class.",

    "text": "Course policies\n\nCollaboration\n-   While you are welcome to discuss lab assignments with classmate, your lab report should be completed individually.\n\n-   For the projects, collaboration within teams is expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of R code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). This is not a course in learning R, but rather interpreting the results of analysis.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you shoulud use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all University of Portland policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more).\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the stated due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances, I will not accept work after those dates.",

    "text": "This course introduces students to the discipline of statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. Focus on principles underlying quantitative research in social sciences, humanities, and public policy. Research projects teach the process of scientific discovery and synthesis and critical evaluation of research and statistical arguments. Readings give perspective on why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nIn this course, you will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. Critiquing data-based claims and evaluating data-based decisions is at the core of this course. Throughout the course students acquire a conceptual understanding and mastery of statistical and quantitative reasoning tools in order to be able to make such critiques and evaluations.\nIn addition, students are presented with novel data sets and application examples on a daily basis, and they use these data to model outcomes and make inferences about unknown population characteristics. Students learn that the first step of any analysis is identifying the assumptions and conditions necessary to apply the statistical technique(s) required to answer the research question at hand. Students not only learn the mechanics of the quantitative analysis, but also how to interpret conclusions based on quantitative evidence in context of the data and the research questions as well as identifying limitations due to data collection and study design.\nFor the lab component of this course students prepare weekly lab reports presenting statistical analysis of real data. In addition, students complete two independent data analysis projects where they answer significant research questions via the analysis of real data using statistical inference and modeling tools.",

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive.\nPlease update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta101-f23.github.io.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Slack. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Slack before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Slack, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

My role as instructor is to introduce you new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to take them and make use of them. A lot of what you do in this course will involve writing code, and coding is a skill that is best learned by doing. Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. Attendance will not be taken during class but you are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.\nIf you have a laptop or table, you may find it helpful to bring it to class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises. However, you will typically be working in groups, so as long as someone at your table has a laptop, that will be sufficient.",

While your attendance and participation do not factor directly into your course grade, they do factor indirectly in that your learning is a direct result of engaging with the material. If you do need to miss class for any reason, you can check the class Moodle page to see what we covered. I will also post all slides.\n\n\nInteractive tutorials\nYou will be assigned a number of interactive tutorials each week from the textbook. You will be asked to submit these on a weekly basis and graded on a check/no check basis.\nMake sure to add your name and your Net ID before generating the hash. Submit these in Canvas.\nIf you’ve completed at least 80% of the tutorials, you’ll get all available points for this component.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in class to various data analysis scenarios. Labs will focus on both computation and conceptualization. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto and submitted as PDF for feedback. While you may collaborate with others on lab assignments, you will need to submit your own final lab report.\n\n\nQuizzes\nWe will have occasional short in-class quizzes. The purpose of these is to check-in where you are in your understanding of various concepts throughout the semester.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be a mid-semester prediction project and a final project. The prediction project will introduce you to conducting independent analyses and writing a formal report using a pre-specified data set. The final project allows you to explore a question and data set of your own. More details about the projects will be provided during the semester. Projects will be completed in teams.\nYou will be assigned to a different team for each of your two projects. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.\nSee Section 4 for dates and times of project deadlines. Project deadlines cannot be changed. If you can’t be in class for the final project presentation, you should drop this class.",

Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of R code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). This is not a course in learning R, but rather interpreting the results of analysis.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you shoulud use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all University of Portland policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more).\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the stated due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances, I will not accept work after those dates.",

Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. We will consider why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nYou will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. You will acquire a conceptual understanding and proficiency in statistical and quantitative reasoning tools to help you critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.\nMTH 161, Elementary Statistics, provides students with an introduction to the methods and concepts involved in working with data and non-deterministic situations. In this class, you will:\n\nexposed to the conceptual structure of statistics and its underpinnings in discrete and continuous probability theory.\nexposed to the pervasive use of statistics in other disciplines.\nexposed to the uses and misuses of statistical inference (e.g. hypothesis tests) in technical journals and the popular press.\nintroduced to concepts in statistical inference, such as the importance of randomized design, how to collect good data, how to analyze the data, and how to carry out and properly interpret the results of hypothesis tests.\ndevelop skills in using computer software to do statistical analysis and inference.\n\nUpon completion of the course you can expect to be conversant in the rudiments of data analysis, probability, hypothesis testing, correlation and regression. At the end of the semester, a successful student will be able to say they can:\n\nPerform an exploratory analysis of univariate and bivariate data.\nSummarize data graphically using histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, etc.\nSummarize data numerically using measures of central tendency and variation.\nRecognize a properly defined probability distribution function.\nCalculate the probabilities of events in a sample space.\nArticulate the concept of a random variable.\nCalculate probabilities associated with basic types of random variables.\nArticulate the Central Limit Theorem.\nCompute and interpret confidence intervals.\nArticulate the underlying reasons for steps in hypothesis testing.\nSetup, conduct and interpret a hypothesis test.\nCalculate and interpret the least-squares regression line correlation coefficient from bivariate data."

You might get stuck on a homework problem or lab exercise or perhaps have a question from class that did not get fully resolved. It is also my experience that significant learning occurs when you are talking through the material with another person. Finally, it’s important to remember that mathematics is a cumulative subject where material builds upon prior knowledge; once you get behind it is very hard to catch up.\nFor these reasons among others, I strongly encourage you to reach out at any time with any question. In addition to emailing me, or stopping by my office, here are some other ways to get help.\n\nDrop-In Student Hours\nI have set aside the times listed below during which I am available for drop-in help. You do not need to let me know you’re coming – just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have any questions.\n\nTuesday 3-4\nWednesday 10-12\nThursday 2-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote – if my schedule changes at any point, I may need to adjust these times. I will post any changes on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign-Up Hours\nI recognize that your schedule might not allow you to stop by during the posted drop-in hours. Or you simply might find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time. If you go to my Calendly scheduler, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in person or via zoom. If there is a specific time that you would like to meet and you don’t see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email.\n\n\nOpen Door\nI have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I’ll be available – but you are always welcome to stop by my office at any time. Unless I’m in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.\n\n\nMath Resource Center\nThe MRC offers both drop-in tutoring as well as scheduled, individualized help. I will post the MRC schedule on Moodle as soon as it becomes available (usually the second week of the semester). Note: the mth 161 tutors in the MRC will likely not be able to help with R questions.",

Add your responses to your lab report under “Exercise 1”.\n\nLet’s take a look at the names of the data sets inside of datasaurus_dozen. To do so this, we can make a frequency table of the “data set” variable. Run the code chunk below. Note: when you run the code chunk below, a table “prints” to the screen. In general, we say “print to screen” to mean that the output of your code should show up on your screen (when asked to ‘print to screen’ in an assignment, you should make sure the output displays in your rendered document).\n\ndatasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  count(dataset)\n\n# A tibble: 13 × 2\n   dataset        n\n   &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;int&gt;\n 1 away         142\n 2 bullseye     142\n 3 circle       142\n 4 dino         142\n 5 dots         142\n 6 h_lines      142\n 7 high_lines   142\n 8 slant_down   142\n 9 slant_up     142\n10 star         142\n11 v_lines      142\n12 wide_lines   142\n13 x_shape      142\n\n\nThe original Datasaurus (dino) data was created by Alberto Cairo. The other Dozen were generated using simulated annealing and the process is described in the paper Same Stats, Different Graphs: Generating data sets with Varied Appearance and Identical Statistics through Simulated Annealing by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. In the paper, the authors simulate a variety of data sets that have the same summary statistics as the original Datasaurus but have very different data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can view the whole data frame by running the code view(datasaurus_dozen) in the console.

    "text": "Exercise 2\n\nPlot y vs. x for the dino data set. Then, calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y for this data set. Make sure that this value is printed in your document.\n\nBelow is the code you will need to complete this exercise. Basically, the answer is already given, but you need to include relevant bits in your .qmd document and successfully render it and view the results.\nStart with the datasaurus_dozen and pipe it into the filter function to filter for observations where dataset == \"dino\". Store the resulting filtered data frame as a new data frame called dino_data.\n\ndino_data &lt;- datasaurus_dozen |&gt;\n  filter(dataset == \"dino\")\n\nThere is a lot going on here, so let’s slow down and unpack it a bit.\nFirst, the pipe operator: |&gt;, takes what comes before it and sends it as the first argument to what comes after it. So here, we’re saying filter the datasaurus_dozen data frame for observations where dataset == \"dino\".\nSecond, the assignment operator: &lt;-, assigns the name dino_data to the filtered data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote in R you may use either &lt;- or = for an assignment operator. We’ll use &lt;- in this class as it’s the more commonly used assignment operator, but when you look for R help online, you might see = being used as well.\n\n\nNext, we need to visualize these data. We will use the ggplot function for this. Its first argument is the data you’re visualizing. Next we define the aesthetic mappings. In other words, the columns of the data that get mapped to certain aesthetic features of the plot, e.g. the x axis will represent the variable called x and the y axis will represent the variable called y. Then, we add another layer to this plot where we define which geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. In this case we want these to be points, hence geom_point.\n\nggplot(dino_data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the second part of this exercise, we need to calculate a summary statistic: the correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient (r) measures the strength and direction of the linear association between two variables. You will see that some of the pairs of variables we plot do not have a linear relationship between them. This is exactly why we want to visualize first: visualize to assess the form of the relationship, and calculate r only if relevant.\nIn this case, calculating a correlation coefficient really doesn’t make sense since the relationship between x and y is definitely not linear, but is instead more ‘dinosaur-esque’.\nFor illustrative purposes only, let’s calculate the correlation coefficient between x and y.\n\ndino_data |&gt;\n  summarize(r = cor(x, y))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n        r\n    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.0645"

Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. We will consider why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nWe will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. We will acquire a conceptual understanding and proficiency in statistical and quantitative reasoning tools to help you critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.\nIn addition, students are presented with novel data sets and application examples on a daily basis, and they use these data to model outcomes and make inferences about unknown population characteristics. Students learn that the first step of any analysis is identifying the assumptions and conditions necessary to apply the statistical technique(s) required to answer the research question at hand. Students not only learn the mechanics of the quantitative analysis, but also how to interpret conclusions based on quantitative evidence in context of the data and the research questions as well as identifying limitations due to data collection and study design.",
