    "text": "Academic Integrity\nThe University of Portland is a diverse academic community of learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity.\nEspecially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at libguides.up.edu/cite.\nThe misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.\n\n\nAssessment Disclosure\nStudent work products for this course may be used by the University for educational quality assurance purposes. For reasons of confidentiality, such examples will not include student names.\n\n\nAccessibility\nThe University of Portland strives to make its courses and services fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a disability are encouraged to use the services of the Office for Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic Resource Center (503-943- 8985). If you have an AES Accommodation Plan, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in the course syllabus.\n\n\nMental Health\nAnyone can experience problems with their mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at UP, please contact the University of Portland Counseling Center in the upper level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or hcc@up.edu. Their services are free and confidential. In addition, mental health consultation and support is available through the Pilot Helpline by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3. The University of Portland Campus Safety Department (503-943-4444) also has personnel trained to respond sensitively to mental health emergencies at all hours. Remember that getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do – for yourself, for those you care about, and for those who care about you. For more information on health and wellness resources at UP go to www.linktr.ee/wellnessUP.\n\n\nNon-Violence\nThe University of Portland is committed to fostering a safe and respectful community free from all forms of violence. Violence of any kind, and in particular acts of power- based personal violence, are inconsistent with our mission. Together, all UP community members must take a stand against violence. Learn more about what interpersonal violence looks like, campus and community resources, UP’s prevention strategy, and what we as individuals can do to assist on the Green Dot website, www.up.edu/greendot. Further information and reporting options may be found on the Title IX website, www.up.edu/titleix.\n\n\nEthics of Information\nThe University of Portland is a community dedicated to the investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information, including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use, information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse.\n###The Learning Commons Students may receive academic assistance through Learning Commons tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get help in writing, math, group projects, and many other courses. Schedule an appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the Learning Commons website (www.up.edu/learningcommons). Students can also meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check the Learning Commons website or stop by the Learning Commons in BC 163 to learn more about their services. Co-Pilots are a wonderful support along your academic journey.",

It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity and in alignment with Duke’s Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.\nFurthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities. To help accomplish this:\n\nIf you have a name that differs from those that appear in your official Duke records, please let me know! You’ll be able to note this in the Getting to know you survey.\nIf you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic dean is an excellent resource.\nI (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please let me or a member of the teaching team know.\n\n\nPronouns\nPronouns are meaningful tools to communicate identities and experiences, and using pronouns supports a campus environment where all community members can thrive.\nPlease update your gender pronouns in Duke Hub. You can learn more at the Center for Sexual and Gender Diversity’s website.\n\n\nAccessibility\nIf there is any portion of the course that is not accessible to you due to challenges with technology or the course format, please let me know so we can make appropriate accommodations.\nThe Student Disability Access Office (SDAO) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments. Students should be in touch with the Student Disability Access Office to request or update accommodations under these circumstances.\n\n\nCommunication\nAll lecture notes, assignment instructions, an up-to-date schedule, and other course materials may be found on the course website: sta101-f23.github.io.\nI will regularly send course announcements via email and Canvas, make sure to check one or the other of these regularly. If an announcement is sent Monday through Thursday, I will assume that you have read the announcement by the next day. If an announcement is sent on a Friday or over the weekend, I will assume that you have read it by Monday.\n\n\nWhere to get help\n\nIf you have a question during lecture or lab, feel free to ask it! There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.\nThe teaching team is here to help you be successful in the course. You are encouraged to attend office hours to ask questions about the course content and assignments. Many questions are most effectively answered as you discuss them with others, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them!\nOutside of class and office hours, any general questions about course content or assignments should be posted on the course Slack. There is a chance another student has already asked a similar question, so please check the other posts on Slack before adding a new question. If you know the answer to a question posted on Slack, I encourage you to respond!\n\nCheck out the Support page for more resources.\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don’t hesitate to ask.\n\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you’re always welcome to talk to me. If I can’t help, I likely know someone who can.\nI want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.",

Therefore, as much as possible, you will be working on a variety of tasks and activities throughout each lecture and lab. Attendance will not be taken during class but you are expected to attend all lecture and lab sessions and meaningfully contribute to in-class exercises and discussion.\nIf you have a laptop or table, you may find it helpful to bring it to class so that you can take part in the in-class exercises.

If you do need to miss class for any reason, you can check the class Moodle page to see what we covered. I will also post all slides.\n\n\nInteractive tutorials\nYou will be assigned a number of interactive tutorials each week from the textbook. You will be asked to submit these on a weekly basis and graded on a check/no check basis.\nMake sure to add your name and your Net ID before generating the hash. Submit these in Canvas.\nIf you’ve completed at least 80% of the tutorials, you’ll get all available points for this component.\n\n\nLabs\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in class to various data analysis scenarios. Labs will focus on both computation and conceptualization. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto and submitted as PDF for feedback. While you may collaborate with others on lab assignments, you will need to submit your own final lab report.\n\n\nQuizzes\nWe will have occasional short in-class quizzes. The purpose of these is to check-in where you are in your understanding of various concepts throughout the semester.\n\n\nProjects\nThere will be a mid-semester prediction project and a final project. The prediction project will introduce you to conducting independent analyses and writing a formal report using a pre-specified data set. The final project allows you to explore a question and data set of your own. More details about the projects will be provided during the semester. Projects will be completed in teams.\nYou will be assigned to a different team for each of your two projects. You are encouraged to sit with your teammates in lecture and you will also work with them in the lab sessions. All team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each project and you will be asked to evaluate your team members after each assignment is due. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your mark relative to the team’s overall mark.\nSee Section 11 for dates and times of project deadlines. Project deadlines cannot be changed. If you can’t be in class for the final project presentation, you should drop this class.",

Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\nOnline resources: I am well aware that a huge volume of R code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g., StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). This is not a course in learning R, but rather interpreting the results of analysis.\nUse of generative artificial intelligence (AI): You should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. There are two guiding principles that govern how you shoulud use AI in this course:1 (1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning. (2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. You may use these guidelines for citing AI-generated content.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is the responsibility of all students to understand and follow all University of Portland policies, including academic integrity (e.g., completing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, adhering to guidance around group work projects, and more).\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the stated due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances, I will not accept work after those dates.",

There are two guiding principles that govern how you can use AI in this course:1\n(1) Cognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly. We will practice using AI to facilitate—rather than hinder—learning.\n(2) Ethical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n✅ AI tools for code: You may make use of the technology for coding examples on assignments; if you do so, you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n❌ AI tools for narrative: Unless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.",
