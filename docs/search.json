I will strive to create an learning environment where all of our different perspectives and identities are valued and respected, where the contributions of every person are celebrated, and where you feel comfortable fully engaging in class.\nWhile I’ll do everything in my power to support you, your success in this course ultimately depends on you. I ask you to bring a readiness to work and a belief that you can learn. I absolutely believe this about each of you. I will also ask you to do tasks that are just at the edge of what you can handle because that is how the best learning happens, but if you are prepared to invest your time and energy, and to communicate with me about how you’re doing, I can and will support you.\nAs we work together this semester, your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. In particular, if you ever feel like your experience in this class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me.

You should should consistently demonstrate this deep understanding of the material using a wide variety of methods described above.

You might get stuck on a homework problem or lab exercise or perhaps have a question from class that did not get fully resolved. It is also my experience that significant learning occurs when you are talking through the material with another person. Finally, it’s important to remember that mathematics is a cumulative subject where material builds upon prior knowledge; once you get behind it is very hard to catch up.\nFor these reasons among others, I strongly encourage you to reach out at any time with any question. In addition to emailing me, or stopping by my office, here are some other ways to get help.\n\nDrop-In Student Hours\nI have set aside the times listed below during which I am available for drop-in help. You do not need to let me know you’re coming – just stop by my office (BC 270). Many students find these drop-in hours can be particularly helpful if you are working together with classmates. You can work together at one of the tables down the hall from my office and just pop in when you have any questions.\n\nTuesday 3-4\nWednesday 10-12\nThursday 2-3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote – if my schedule changes at any point, I may need to adjust these times. I will post any changes on Moodle.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign-Up Hours\nI recognize that your schedule might not allow you to stop by during the posted drop-in hours. Or you simply might find it more convenient to meet with me at a different time. If you go to my Calendly scheduler, you can sign-up for a time slot to meet, either in person or via zoom. If there is a specific time that you would like to meet and you don’t see it available on the Calendly scheduler, please reach out to me via email.\n\n\nOpen Door\nI have the scheduled drop-in hours simply to give you some times when you know that I’ll be available – but you are always welcome to stop by my office at any time. Unless I’m in class or in a meeting, I will generally be available to meet with you.\n\n\nMath Resource Center\nThe MRC offers both drop-in tutoring as well as scheduled, individualized help. I will post the MRC schedule on Moodle as soon as it becomes available (usually the second week of the semester). Note: the mth 161 tutors in the MRC will likely not be able to help with R questions.",

    "text": "Departure Delays\nLet’s start by examining the distribution of departure delays of all flights with a histogram using the variable dep_delay\n\nggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_histogram(col=\"white\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistograms are generally a very good way to see the shape of a single distribution of numerical data, but that shape can change depending on how the data is split between the different bins. You can easily define the binwidth you want to use:\n\nggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 15, col=\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data = nycflights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 150, col=\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\n\n\nLook carefully at these three histograms. How do they compare? Are there features revealed in one that are obscured in another? What can you learn about delays in departure time from these histograms?\n\n\n\nFiltering\nSuppose we’re only interested in flights headed to Portland, OR. We can filter the data for flights with that destination (dest == \"PDX\") and then make a histogram of the departure delays of only those flights.\n\npdx_flights &lt;- nycflights |&gt;\n  filter(dest == \"PDX\")\n\nggplot(data = pdx_flights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, col=\"white\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s decipher these two commands (OK, so it might look like four lines, but the first two physical lines of code are actually part of the same command. It’s common to add a break to a new line after |&gt; to help readability).\n\nCommand 1: Take the nycflights data frame, filter for flights headed to PDX, and save the result as a new data frame called pdx_flights. By creating a new data frame, we can use it for further analysis later on.\n\n== means “if it’s equal to”.\nPDX is in quotation marks since it is a character string.\n\nCommand 2: Basically the same ggplot call from earlier for making a histogram, except that it uses the smaller data frame for flights headed to PDX instead of all flights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFiltering for certain observations (e.g. flights from a particular airport) is often of interest in data frames where we might want to examine observations with certain characteristics separately from the rest of the data. To do so, you can use the filter function and a series of logical operators. The most commonly used logical operators for data analysis are as follows:\n\n== means “equal to”\n!= means “not equal to”\n&gt; or &lt; means “greater than” or “less than”\n&gt;= or &lt;= means “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to”\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerical Summaries\nNow let’s look at some numerical summaries for these flights:\n\npdx_flights |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_dd   = mean(dep_delay), \n            median_dd = median(dep_delay), \n            n         = n())\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  mean_dd median_dd     n\n    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1    10.8         0   136\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2\n\n\n\nIn your own words, explain the significance of the three numbers generated by the above R code.\n\n\nNote that with the summarise function we created a list of three different numerical summaries that we’re interested in. The names of these elements are user defined, like mean_dd, median_dd, n, and you can customize these names as you like (just don’t use spaces in your names). Calculating these summary statistics also requires that you know the function calls. Note that n() reports the sample size.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSummary statistics: Some useful function calls for summary statistics for a single numerical variable are as follows:\n\nmean\nmedian\nsd\nvar\nIQR\nmin\nmax\n\nNote that each of these functions takes a single vector as an argument and returns a single value.\n\n\nWe can also filter based on multiple criteria. Suppose we’re interested in flights headed to Portland (PDX) in July:\n\npdx_jul_flights &lt;- nycflights |&gt;\n  filter(dest == \"PDX\", month == 7)\n\nNote that we can separate the conditions using commas if we want flights that are both headed to PDX and in July If we are interested in either flights headed to PDX or in July, we can use the | instead of the comma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 3\n\n\n\nWe just created a new data frame called pdx_jul_flights that includes flights headed to PDX in July. How many flights meet these criteria?\n\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4\n\n\n\nDescribe the distribution of the arrival delays of these flights using a histogram and appropriate summary statistics.\n\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n\nSummary statistics for groups\nAnother useful technique is to calculate summary statistics for various groups in your data frame. For example, we can modify the above command using the group_by function to get the same summary stats for each origin airport:\n\nnycflights |&gt;\n  group_by(origin) |&gt;\n  summarise(median_dd = median(dep_delay), mean_dd = mean(dep_delay), iqr_dd = IQR(dep_delay), n_flights = n())\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 5\n  origin median_dd mean_dd iqr_dd n_flights\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n1 EWR           -1    15.3     19     11771\n2 JFK           -1    12.3     15     10897\n3 LGA           -3    10.1     13     10067\n\n\nThis shows us that LaGuardia Airport (LGA) has the smallest average departure delay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5\n\n\n\nCalculate the median and interquartile range for dep_delay for flights in the pdx_flights data frame, grouped by carrier. Which carrier has the most variable departure delays?\n\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n\nDeparture delays by carrier\nSuppose you really dislike departure delays and so you want to choose an airline that minimizes your potential departure delay leaving NYC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6\n\n\n\nTo answer this question, we can use code like the example above to:\n-   `group_by` `carrier`, then\n-   `summarise` mean departure delays.\nWhich carrier has the highest average delay departing from an NYC airport?\n\n\n\n# add code here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7\n\n\n\nRather than choosing the carrier with the lowest mean departure delay, we could instead choose the carrier with the lowest median departure delay. What are the pros and cons of these two choices?",

Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. We will consider why in 1950, S. Wilks said, “Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a qualification for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.”\nWe will learn how to effectively make use of data in the face of uncertainty: how to collect data, how to analyze data, and how to use data to make inferences and conclusions about real world phenomena. We will acquire a conceptual understanding and proficiency in statistical and quantitative reasoning tools to help you critique and evaluate data-based claims and decisions.\nIn addition, students are presented with novel data sets and application examples on a daily basis, and they use these data to model outcomes and make inferences about unknown population characteristics. Students learn that the first step of any analysis is identifying the assumptions and conditions necessary to apply the statistical technique(s) required to answer the research question at hand. Students not only learn the mechanics of the quantitative analysis, but also how to interpret conclusions based on quantitative evidence in context of the data and the research questions as well as identifying limitations due to data collection and study design.",

Since our focus is not specifically on learning R, but rather on interpreting and understanding results, you may make use of online resources for coding examples unless I explicitly tell you not to use something. You do need to explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration).\nThis policy includes the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as Chat GPI. You should be mindful, however, of the following guiding principles for using AI in this course:1\n\nCognitive dimension: Working with AI should not reduce your ability to think clearly.\nEthical dimension: Students using AI should be transparent about their use and make sure it aligns with academic integrity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nUnless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments. In general, you may use generative AI as a coding resource as you complete assignments but not to answer the exercises for you. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the stated due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances, I will not accept work after those dates."

We’ll access R via web platform Posit Cloud. You will need a posit cloud student account to access course materials. Note that there is a small fee ($5 per month) for this subscription.\n\n\nCollaboration\nUnless otherwise instructed, I encourage you to work together with classmates on class assignments, although any work that you hand in (unless it’s a group assignment) should be your own.\n\n\nOnline resources (including AI)\nI am well aware that a huge volume of R code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Since the focus of this course is not learning R, but rather interpreting the results of statistical analysis you may - unless explicitly told otherwise - make use of any online resources to obtain R code. You do need to explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or are inspired by.\nYou should treat generative AI, such as ChatGPT, the same as other online resources. Again, if you do use AI tools for help in coding, you must explicity cite this.\nUnless instructed otherwise, you may not use generative AI to write narrative on assignments or to assist in answering exercises or homework problems. You are ultimately responsible for the work you turn in; it should reflect your understanding of the course content.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nDue dates for assignments are there to give you structure and to help you keep up with the course material. They also help me provide you with feedback in a timely manner. That said, I understand that things come up periodically that can make it difficult to complete an assignment by the deadline. Life happens!\nIf something comes up that prevents you from completing an assignment by the posted due date, just send me email and let me know when I can expect your work. You do not need to provide an explanation. In general, I will expect to receive your work within one week.\nThere are, however, two hard deadlines to be aware of: Oct. 11th (Friday before Fall break) and Dec. 6th (last day of classes). Except in unusual circumstances or by prior arrangement, I will not accept work after those dates.\n\n\nImportant dates\n\nTuesday, August 27: Classes begin\nFriday, August 30: Last day to add/drop\nFriday, October 13: First hard deadline, Project 1 due\nMonday, October 15: Fall Break begins\nMonday, November 25: Last day to Withdraw\nThursday, November 28: Thanksgiving\nFriday, December 6: Last day of classes; 2nd hard deadline, Project 2 due\nMonday, December 9: Section H check-in, 10:30-12:30\nWednesday, December 11: Section I check-in, 1:30-3:30.",

The goal is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\nPart 1 - due Nov. 15th\nFind a dataset and choose a research question.\nPart 2 - due Dec. 6\n\nIf you get me your report by Nov. 27th, I will give you feedback and you will be able to make corrections and resubmit by Dec. 6th.\n\nNote that Dec. 6th is a hard deadline – I will not accept any reports after this.\n\nYou do not need to do an exhaustive data analysis, i.e. do not calculate every statistic and procedure you have learned for every variable, but rather show me that you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with results of data analysis, that you are proficient in using R, and that you are proficient at interpreting and presenting the results. Focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions. You should critique your own methods and provide suggestions for improving your analysis. Issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data, and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should be discussed where appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile this project is very open ended, you should, at a minimum\n\ncreate some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data, and\nperform statistical inference and/or fit a model for descriptive or predictive purposes\n\n\n\nYou should stick with R packages and techniques that we have seen in class. (If you want to use content that goes beyond what we’ve discussed in class, you should be prepared to justify how and why it works.) Your report should be clearly written and have meaningful visualizations. A single high-quality visualization is generally better than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. All analyses must be done in RStudio (posit.cloud) and all components of the project must be reproducible.",

This might include a snippet of data (using your favorite code), a codebook explaining what the variables are, and/or a calculation that has pointed you to a question about the data that you find compelling: whatever you feel is needed to help frame your research question. Finally, make sure your research question is articulated precisely with clear reference to the variable(s) or parameter(s) of interest. Past AEs, labs, and the first project all contain examples of carefully stated research questions.\nThere is a blank template in Posit Cloud for you to use. Please submit a PDF of Part I on Moodle by Nov 15th.\n\nResources for datasets\nYou are welcome to use a dataset that we’ve seen in class, as long as your research question is a new one and your dataset meets the above requirements. Many of the datasets featured in our textbook can be found here:\n\nOpenintro (datasets featured in the textbook)\n\nHere is a short list of sources for interesting datasets in easy-to-access formats.

The goal here is to say something interesting and meaningful about your topic while showing me that you learned something this semester. You don’t have to cover every single technique or concept from the class – instead, focus on methods that help you begin to answer your research questions.\nWhile this project is very open ended, you should probably:\n\ncreate some kind of compelling visualization(s) of this data, and\nperform statistical inference and/or fit a model or descriptive or predictive purposes\n\nYou should stick with R packages and techniques that we have seen in class. Your report should be clearly written and have meaningful visualizations. A single high-quality visualization is generally better than a large number of poor-quality visualizations. All analyses must be done in RStudio (posit.cloud) and all components of the project must be reproducible.\nWhat to submit: using the same template in posit.cloud that you used for part 1, add your analysis and discussion. Your report should be organized into sections such as introduction, preliminary analysis, summary/conclusions, etc. Take a look at previous labs and project 1 for examples.\nSave your report as a pdf file and submit to Moodle.\nPart 2 is due Dec. 6\n\nIf you get me your report by Nov. 27th, I will give you feedback and you will be able to make corrections and resubmit by Dec. 6th.\n\nNote that Dec. 6th is a hard deadline – I cannot not accept any reports after this.",
