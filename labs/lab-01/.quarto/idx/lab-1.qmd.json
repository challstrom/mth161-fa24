Even if we're mostly cutting and pasteing from other sources, it's good to be aware of these conventions!\n\n1.  There should be a line break after each `|>` in a pipeline or `+` in a ggplot.\n\n2.  There should be spaces around `=` signs.\n\n3.  There should be a space after each `,`\n\n4.  Code should be properly indented.\n\n5.  Code should not exceed 80 characters in each line. You can use line breaks to spread longer lines of code across multiple lines. In the rendered document, you shouldn't have to scroll to see all your code.\n\n6.  Code chunks should be labeled, informatively and without spaces.\n\nThese guidelines follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). This style guide is commonly used and will help make your code more legible.\n\n# The data: `palmerpenguins`\n\nLast week in class, we worked with the `palmerpenguins` package which contains measurement and other data for 344 penguins. There are 3 different species of penguins in the dataset, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n\n```{r}\nglimpse(penguins)\n```\n\n### Task 1\n\n> Based on the results of `glimpse(penguins)`, how many rows and how many columns does the `penguins` data frame have? What are the **variables** included in the data frame? Add your responses to your lab report under this paragraph.\n\n## Investigating Variable Associations\n\nIn this lab, we want to investigate the relationship between the two numerical variables `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm`.\n\n![](images/culmen_depth.png){fig-alt=\"Where to find the file\" width=\"300\"}\n\nWe can start by making a simple scatterplot for these two numerical variables.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: scatterplot\n\nggplot(data = penguins,\n       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\nWe are using the `ggplot` function to create this visualization. The first argument specifies what data we're visualizing. Next, we specify how we want to use the data to make the graph. This is accomplished by defining the mapping of the data to certain aesthetic (`aes`) features of the plot. In this case, we want the x axis to represent a certain variable, and the y axis to represent some other variable.\n\nFinally, we add one more layer to this plot where we define what geometric shapes we want to use to represent each observation in the data. Here we want these to be points, hence `geom_point`.\n\n### Task 2\n\n> Using the language introduced in section 1.2 of the textbook, how would you describe the association between these two variables?\n\n### Task 3\n\n> One thing we already know about our penguin data is that there are 3 different species. However, our scatterplot does not reflect this! Add a code chunk below and add code to produce a new scatterplot in which the points are colored by species. You can refer back to AE-01 that we did in class to see how to do this. While you're at it, map the shape of the points to species as well!\n\n```{r}\n\n```\n\n### Task 4\n\n>How does adding color change your understanding of the association between these two variables?\n\n### Task 5\n\n>Add a code chunk here to visualize the association between two other numerical variables of your choice. What do you observe?\n\n# Submit your report\n\n::: callout-important\nBefore you proceed, first, make sure that you have updated the document YAML with your name!
