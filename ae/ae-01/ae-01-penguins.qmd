In this activity, we will meet some penguins, start thinking about data and variables, and see some R code in action. The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") R package contains size measurements for three species of penguins observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

In order to access this data, we need to load the package into R. While we're at it, we can load any other packages that we need.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: true
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## A First Look at the Data

Let's take a peek at the data with the following R code:

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

This command gives us a table (tibble) which shows us the first six rows of the **data frame** called `penguins`. When working with data, we typically want each row to be an individual observation (or case), each column to be a variable, and each entry (cell) to be a single value. Data that is in this format is called **tidy**. A significant part of the work involved in analyzing data is getting it tidy (a process often referred to as "cleaning the data") or at least accounting for ways in which it isn't tidy.

::: {.callout-note title="Questions" icon="false"}
-   What does each row in this data frame represent?
-   Is this data tidy? Why or why not?
-   What do you think the result of the R command `head(penguins, 10)` would be? Try it!
-   What other questions do you have about this table?
:::

### Other points of view

Here are two other R commands we can use to view the data.

```{r}
print(penguins)
```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

::: {.callout-note title="Questions" icon="false"}
-   What differences do you notice between these two R commands?
-   How many penguins are included in this dataset?
-   How many variables are there? Which are numerical? Which are categorical?
:::

## Summary Statistics

A **summary statistic** is a single number that summarizes our data in some meaningful way. For example, we might ask:

-   What percentage of our Adelie penguins were found on Torgersen island?
-   What is the average (mean) flipper length of our penguins?

We can use R to help us analyze the data to answer these questions. We might start by counting how many penguins of each species there are.

```{r}
penguins |>
  count(species)
```

We can do something similar to determine how many penguins are on each island.

::: {.callout-note title="Try It!" icon="false"}
Add a code chunk that determines how many penguins are on each island. Does this help us answer our question? Why or why not?
:::

To answer our question, it seems we need to dig deeper. Here we produce what's sometimes called a two-way, or contingency table. We'll see these again in Chapter 5.

```{r}
table(penguins$species, penguins$island)
```

::: {.callout-note title="Task" icon="false"}
Determine what percentage of the Adelie penguins are on Torgenson island.
:::

## Relationships between Variables

An important tool in understanding and analyzing data is visualization. For example, we can use a **scatterplot** to help us understand relationships between variables. Let's look at a scatterpolot that compares body mass and flipper length.

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguins, 
       mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point()

```

::: {.callout-note title="Questions" icon="false"}
-   What does each point on the graph represent?
-   Based on this scatterplot, how would you describe the relationship between these two variables?
-   When we ran the code to make this graph, a warning message appeared. What do you think is going on? (hint: go back and look at the data frame.)
:::

R gives us the ability to modify and customize our visualizations a great deal -- indeed this is one of the main strengths of R! Let's add one more feature to our graph. As we know, there are three different species of penguins in our data set -- but our scatter plot does not show this!

```{r}
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species))
```

::: {.callout-note title="Questions" icon="false"}
-   How does the addition of coloring by species change your understanding of this graph?
-   What additional questions about this data can you come up with?
:::

Because people can perceive colors differently due to color blindness or other color vision differences and since different devices might display colors in unexpected ways, it's good practice to not rely on color alone to distinguish points.

::: {.callout-note icon="false" title="Try it!"}
Modify your mapping of the points to include shape by adding `shape = species` to the `aes` mapping for the points. Don't forget a comma!
