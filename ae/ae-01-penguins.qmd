In this application exercise, we will meet some penguins, start thinking about data and variables, and see some R code in action.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for three species of penguins observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

## Task 1

Let's take a peek at the data with the following R code:

```{r}
head(penguins)
```

This tables shows us the first six rows of **data frame** containing this data. When working with data, we typically want each row to be an individual observation (or case), each column to be a variable and each entry (cell) to be a single value. Data in this format is called **tidy**.

**Question:** What observations can you make about this table?

## Task 2

Here are many other ways to view data frames.

```{r}
print(penguins)
```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

**Question:** what are the differences between these R commands?

**Questions:** How many penguins are included in this dataset? How many variables?

## Task 3

Let's take a look at other ways to analyize our data using R. What is the code chunk below doing?

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(species)
```

### Exercise:

Add a code chunk that does something similar to determine how many penguins are on each island.

```{r}
penguins %>%
  count(island)

count(penguins, island)
```

## Task 4

```{r}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))
```

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
