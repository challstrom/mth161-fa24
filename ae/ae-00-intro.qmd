In this activity, we will meet some penguins, start thinking about data and variables, and see some R code in action. The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") R package contains size measurements for three species of penguins observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.

Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/).

In order to access this data, we need to load the package into R. While we're at it, we can load any other packages that we need.

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| include: true
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## A First Look at the Data


An important tool in understanding and analyzing data is visualization. For example, we can use a **scatterplot** to help us understand relationships between variables. Let's look at a scatterpolot that compares body mass and flipper length.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

ggplot(data = penguins,
                         aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                             y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(title = "Penguin bill dimensions (omit species)",
       subtitle = "Palmer Station LTER",
       x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)") +
  theme(plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, face= "italic"),
        plot.caption.position = "plot")
```
