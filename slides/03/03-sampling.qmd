## Announcements

-   Think about what you will add to this week's engagement report.
-   Lab 01 due on Friday

## More Penguins

Recall our `palmerpenguins` data frame

```{r}
#| label: load-packages
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

\
Where did this data come from?

## Begin with Research Question(s)

\

### Can physical measurements be used to determine sex in penguins?

\
From 2007 to 2009 Dr. Kristen Gorman and colleauges collected data to try to answer this and other questions.

## Observational Study

-   What is the **population** in question?

    -   Collect data for every case in the population -\> **census**

    -   Collect data for smaller fraction -\> **sample**

-   Find (calculate) a numerical summary relevant to our question.

    -   Number calculated for entire population -\> **parameter**
    -   Number calculated for sample -\> **statistic**

\

### Hopefully, the statistic is close to the parameter!

## Sampling Methods

Goal: choose sample so that it accurately represents the population.

\

**Challenges** (making sure sample represents entire population)

-   **non-response** rates in surveys
-   How were samples chosen -- are they truly random?
-   watch out for **convenience** samples!

## Simple Random Sample

Simple to understand, but often difficult to implement for large populations!

## Stratified Sampling

![](stratified.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

Population is divided into groups (**strata**). Then another method (e.g. simple random sampling) is used within each stratum.

## Cluster Sample

![](cluster.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"} Population divided into groups (**clusters**) and a fixed number of clusters are chosen (sampled). All observations within a cluster are used.

-   Typically, clusters are similar to each other

## Multistage Sampling

![](multistage.png){fig-align="center" width="1000"}

Again, clusters -- but then sampling within the clusters.

## Penguins

Three separate populations: all Gentoo, Adelie, Chinstrap penguins in Palmer Archipelago region of Antarctica.

Q: How would **you** sample?
