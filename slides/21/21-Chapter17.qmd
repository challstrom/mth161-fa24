## CPR + blood thinner survival rates

> Patients who received CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) after a heart attack were randomly divided into two groups. The **treatment** group was given a blood thinner, the **control** group was given none. Did the blood thinner meaningfully impact survival rates (over 24 hours)?

\ 
 
Can we use a normal distribution to model this situation? We must check CLT conditions for [both groups]{.red}: treatment and control.

## CPR + blood thinner survival rates

![](images/cprtable.png){width="100%"} 


- Independence?  Patients assigned randomly. $\checkmark$
- Success/failure condition? In [both groups]{.red} (treatment and control) we see at least 10 successes (e.g. survival) and 10 failures. $\checkmark$

## CPR confidence interval

![](images/cprtable.png){width="70%"}

Build a 95% confidence interval for the survival rate difference between these two groups.

$$
\hat{p}_T - \hat{p}_C = \frac{14}{40} - \frac{11}{50} = .35 - .22 = .13
$$
What does it mean that the difference in proportions is [positive]{.red}?

## CPR confidence interval

[NEW!]{.red} Standard error calculation now also involves [both groups]{.red}: 
$$
\begin{align}
SE &= \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}  }\\
{~~~~~~~} &= \sqrt{ \frac{.35(1-.35)}{40} + \frac{.22(1-.22)}{50}  } \\
 &= .095496
 \end{align}
$$

## Building the confidence interval

We found $\hat{p}_T - \hat{p}_C = .13$ and SE = .095

\
$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{CI} &= \textrm{point estimate} \pm \textrm{margin of error}\\
&= \textrm{point estimate} \pm \, z^* \cdot SE \\
&= .13 \pm 1.96(.095) \\
&= .13 \pm .1862 \\
&= (-.0562, .3162)
\end{align}
$$
Where did this $z^*$ come from?  
Interpret what this interval tells us.

## Fish Oil Benefits
> A five-year experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of n-3 fatty acid supplements (fish oils) on reducing heart attacks.


|  | heart attack | no event | Total |
|------|------|------|------|
| fish oil    | 145      | 12788      | 12933      |
| placebo     | 200      | 12738      | 12938      |


## Test statistic

We're interested in the [difference of two proportions]{.red}

$$\hat{p}_{1} = \frac{145}{12933} = 0.0112$$
$$\hat{p}_{2} = \frac{200}{12938} = 0.0155$$
$$ 
\hat{p}_{1} - \hat{p}_{2} = 0.0112-0.0155 = -0.0043
$$
Is this observed difference significant?  Or is it the result of random variation?

## Hypothesis Test

- Null hypothesis:  there is no difference between the two groups
$$
H_0:  p_1 - p_2 = 0
$$

- Alternative hypothesis:  patients that took the fish oil supplement had a reduced rate of heart attack
$$
H_A:  p_1 - p_2 < 0
$$
- [Special case]{.red}: when $H_0$ is that the proportions are **equal**, we use a [pooled proportion]{.red} to check conditions and find SE.


## Verify conditions for the model

- Independent?  Yes, this was a randomized study

- Large enough sample size?  Use [pooled proportion]{.red}.

$$
\begin{align}
\hat{p}_{\mbox{pool}} = \frac{ \mbox{number of successes}}{\mbox{number of cases}}
&=\frac{\hat{p}_1 n_1 + \hat{p}_2 n_2}{n_1 + n_2}\\
&= \frac{145 + 200}{25871}
\end{align}
$$

$$
\hat{p}_{\mbox{pool}} = 0.0133
$$


## Sample Size, continued

Use pooled proportion $\hat{p}_\mbox{pool}$ written simply as $\hat{p}$

- $n_1 \hat{p} \geq 10$ and $n_1 (1 - \hat{p}) \geq 10$
- $n_2 \hat{p} \geq 10$ and $n_2 (1 - \hat{p}) \geq 10$

In this example,

- $12933 * 0.0133 = 172$
- $12933 * (1-0.0133)$
- $12938 * 0.0133$
- $12938 * (1-0.0133)$

## Standard Error and Z-score

For difference of two proportions, we use our [new formula]{.red} with the pooled proportion for both groups

$$
SE = \sqrt{ \frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}  }\\
= \sqrt{ \hat{p}(1- \hat{p}) \left ( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right ) }
$$
$$
\begin{align}
SE &=
\sqrt{ 0.0133(1-0.0133)\left ( \frac{1}{12933} + \frac{1}{12938} \right )} \\
&= 0.0014
\end{align}
$$



## Calculate Z-score

$$
\begin{align}
Z = \frac{ (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)}{ SE} &= \frac{ (\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)}{ \sqrt{ \hat{p}(1- \hat{p}) \left ( \frac{1}{n_1} + \frac{1}{n_2} \right ) }} \\
&= \frac{ -0.0043}{0.0014} \\
&= -3.071
\end{align}
$$

## p-value

How unlikely is it to observe a Z-score of -3.071, or more extreme?


```{r, out.width="60%"}
#| echo: false
openintro::normTail(m=0, s=1, L=-3.07)
```

```{r}
pnorm(-3.07)
```

## Conclusion

Since the p-value of 0.001 is less than discernment level $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  It appears that the observed difference is significant suggesting that fish oil supplements do decrease incidents of heart attacks.
