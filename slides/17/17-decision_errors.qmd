## Hypothesis Testing Framework

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.red {
  color: #B8001F;
}
```

1.  State the [null hypothesis]{.red} and the [alternative
    hypothesis]{.red}

::: fragment
2.  Choose a [sample]{.red}, collect and analyze the data
:::

::: fragment
3.  How [likely]{.red} is it to see data like what we observed, [if the
    null hypothesis were true]{.red}?
:::

::: fragment
4.  If very unlikely, we [reject]{.red} the null hypothesis. Otherwise,
    we [cannot reject]{.red} the null claim.

## Making a decision

If the conditional probability of obtaining our test statistic, [or more
extreme]{.red}, is very small: $$
p < \alpha
$$ We have evidence to [reject]{.red} the null hypothesis.

This probability is the [p-value]{.red} and the [discernment level
($\alpha$)]{.red} (or significance level) is our threshold for "very
small".

## Making a decision

On the other hand, if the p-value is greater (or equal to) $\alpha$, we
say the results are not statistically significant and we [fail to
reject]{.red}.

\

Note: we [don't]{.red} say $H_0$ is true -- just that we don't have
evidence to say it's not!

## Choosing a discernability level

This should always be done [before]{.red} seeing the data!

\
What are the consequences of making an incorrect decision?

## Type I Error

### Suppose that the null hypothesis is actually [true]{.red}

\

-   we might correcly fail to reject (good decision)

-   we might [incorrectly]{.red} reject the null hypothesis

## Type II Error

### Suppose that the null hypothesis is actually [not true]{.red}

\

-   we might correcly reject (good decision)

-   we might [incorrectly]{.red} fail to reject the null hypothesis

## Decision Errors

\

Suppose the null hypothesis is $H_0$

-   [Type I Error]{.red}: rejecting $H_0$ when it is actually true
-   [Type II Error]{.red}: not rejecting $H_0$ when it is actually false

How likely these errors are depends on [discernment level]{.red}.

What are the consequences for making each type of error?

Choose [$\alpha$]{.red} accordingly!

## Example

::: small
> A researcher believes that the mean number of pesticides is higher in
> the Willamette river than compared to a 1996 report that cited 36
> different pesticides. The researcher collects samples from the river
> over a yearâ€™s time and found a significant increase in the mean number
> of pesticides.
:::

::: incremental
-   State the null and alternative hypotheses.
-   What has happened if a type I error occurs -- what are the potential
    consequences?
-   What has happened if a type II error occurs -- what are the
    potential consequences?
:::

## Controlling for Errors

-   To avoid Type I errors, make it [harder]{.red} to reject $H_0$ -- make
    discernment level [smaller]{.red}

-   To avoid Type II errors, make it [easier]{.red} to reject $H_0$ --
    make discernment level [bigger]{.red}
