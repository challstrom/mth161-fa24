## Associations between two numerical variables

- Explanatory variable: $x$, independent 
(a variable you think might be related to response )
- Response variable: $y$, dependent 
(a variable you want to understand)

## Data: `possum`

```{r, out.width = "85%"}
data(possum)

glimpse(possum)
```


## Possums: `tail_l' vs 'total_l' 

Do possums' tail length and total body length seem to be associated?  Might knowing one help us predict the other?

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() +
   labs(x = "Length of Possum Tail (cm)",
       y = "Length of Possum Body (cm)")
```


## Linear model: "line of best fit"

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
#| echo: true

ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


## Finding the "least squares" regression line

Recall: a line has the equation
$$ y=mx+b$$
where $m$ = slope and $b$ = $y$-intercept.  Here, we want a line of the form

$$ \textrm{Total body length} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot \textrm{(Tail length)} $$

How could you use this line to predict the total body length of a possum with tail 41.6 cm long?



## Properties

The **least squares regression line** has the following properties:

- Minimizes (sum of squared) distance between data points and line
- The *residuals* balance out above and below line
- The point $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ always lies on line (though it's not necessarily a data point!)


## Correlation coefficient, *r*

Also called the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation, here's how *r* is calculated:
$$ r(x,y) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2 \cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2 }}$$
This is a good computation to have R do for us!

## Correlation coefficient, *r*

```{r}
#| echo: true
possum |>
  summarize(N = n(), 
      r = cor(tail_l, total_l, 
              use = "pairwise.complete.obs"))

```

What does this number mean?


## Visualizing the correlation coefficient, *r*

![](09images/correlation.png){fig-align="center" width="400"}

What would a correlation of $r = -0.998$ look like?  How about $r=1$?


## Finding the "least squares" regression line

$$ y = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x $$
First we find the slope: $$b_1 = r \left( \frac{s_y}{s_x} \right)$$

where: 

- $r$ = correlation coefficient
- $s_y$ = standard deviation of $y$
- $s_x$ = standard deviation of $x$

Next we use the fact that $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ lies on our line to solve for the intercept, $b_0$: 

$$\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot \bar{x} $$



## Example (continued)

To model the association between `tail_l` and `total_l`, we need summary statistics to find the slope and intercept of the linear regression:

```{r}
#| echo = TRUE
  
possum |>
  summarize( 
    mean_x = mean(tail_l),
    sd_x = sd(tail_l),
    mean_y = mean(total_l),
    sd_y = sd(total_l),
    r = cor(tail_l, total_l)
    )
```

What line does this produce?


## Example: `Possum` regression line

First, find the slope: 

$$
b_1 = r \cdot \left( \frac{s_y}{s_x} \right) = .566 \left( \frac{4.31}{1.96} \right) = 1.24
$$
Next, use $(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$ to find the intercept:
$$
\bar{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot \bar{x}  \quad \implies \quad 87.1 = b_0 + 1.24(37.0)  
$$

$$
\implies  b_0 = 87.1 - 1.24 (37.0) = 41.2
$$ 

Thus: $y = 41.2 + 1.24 x$ is the linear model describing these two possum variables.

## Example: `Possum` regression line

$$
y = 41.2 + 1.24 x
$$

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
#| echo: false

ggplot(data = possum, aes(y = total_l, x = tail_l)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


## Example: `Possum` regression line

Alternately, we can find the entire **linear model** in one go:
```{r}
#| message: false

library(tidymodels)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| 
 model_fit <- linear_reg() |>
      fit(total_l ~ tail_l, data = possum)
 
tidy(model_fit)
```

- What does the intercept (41) mean?  
- What does the slope (1.24) tell us?
