## Last time...

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

In response to buyer's prompt, seller either [discloses]{.red} the known
issue or [does not]{.red}.

Is the buyer's question [independent]{.red} of whether the seller
disclosed the problem?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We found expected counts for each group...

Then calculated $\chi^2$

$$
\chi^2 = \sum\frac{( O - E)^2}{E}
$$

## Chi-squared

\begin{multline}
\chi^2 = \frac{(2 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} + \frac{(23-20.33)^2}{20.33} + \\
\frac{(36-20.33)^2}{20.33} + 
\frac{(71 -52.67)^2}{52.67} + \\
\frac{(50-52.67)^2}{52.67} + \frac{(37-52.67)^2}{52.67} \\
= 40.13
\end{multline}

# How can we make this calculation easier?

## Option 1: Desmos

## Option 2: Spreadsheet

## Option 3: simple R

### Make a two-way table

```{r}
#| warning: false
observed <- c(2, 23, 36, 71, 50, 37)

two_way <- matrix(observed, 3, 2)

two_way
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chi-squared test

```{r}
chisq.test(two_way)
```

## Larger datasets

For larger datasets, it's not practical to enter numbers by hand!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Example

> An experiment was run to evaluate three treatments for Type 2 Diabetes
> in patients aged 10-17 who were being treated with metformin. The
> three treatments considered were continued treatment with metformin
> (met), treatment with metformin combined with rosiglitazone (rosi), or
> a lifestyle intervention program. Each patient had a primary outcome,
> which was either lacked glycemic control (failure) or did not lack
> that control (success).

## two-way (contingency) table

![](images/diabetes.png){width="95%"}

$H_0$: treatment and outcome are independent

$H_A$: there is a difference in outcomes between the treatments

## Load dataset

```{r}
library(openintro)
print(diabetes2)
```

## Option 4

```{r}
cont_table <- table(diabetes2$treatment, diabetes2$outcome)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
cont_table
```

\

```{r}
chisq.test(cont_table)
```

## Option 5: use `infer` package

```{r}
library(infer)

chisq_test(diabetes2, treatment ~ outcome)

```

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.red {
color: #B8001F;
}
```
