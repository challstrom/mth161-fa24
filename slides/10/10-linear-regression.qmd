## Goals

-   Interpreting $r$ (correlation coefficient)
-   Interpreting linear model

## Correlation Coefficient

::: {.callout-note icon="false" appearance="simple"}
A number between -1 and 1 which describes the strength and direction of a **linear** relationship. Denoted $r$
:::

## What do these datasets all have in common?

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(datasauRus)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

 ggplot(datasaurus_dozen, aes(x = x, y = y, colour = dataset))+
    geom_point()+
    theme_void()+
    theme(legend.position = "none")+
    facet_wrap(~dataset, ncol = 5)
```

::: fragment
The all have roughly the same correlation $r = -0.06$

Correlation is only meaningful for **linear** assocations
:::

## Strength of Fit

Correlation $r$ describes strength and direction of linear relationships

more commonly use $r^2$ -- which is usually capitalized $R^2$.

\

> $R^2$ measures the amount of variation in outcome variable that's explained by the linear model.

## $R^2$ Example

For our cricket chirps we found $r=0.825$

so $R^2 = (0.825)^2 = 0.681$.

> This means that $0.681$ or $68.1$% of the variation we see in cricket chirp rates can be explained by the ambient temperature. What might account for the other $31.9$% of the variation in chirps?

## `crickets` {visibility="hidden"}

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false

crickets <- read_csv("../data/crickets.csv")
```

## Linear Regression

$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 \cdot \hat{x} $$

```{r, out.width = "90%"}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

ggplot(data = crickets, aes(x = temp_F, y = chirps_in_15s)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## A Shortcut!

```{r}
#| echo: true

 model_fit <- linear_reg() |>
      fit(chirps_in_15s ~ temp_F, data = crickets)
 
tidy(model_fit)
```

$$ \hat{y} = -0.372 + 0.212 \, \hat{x} $$

## Don't Extrapolate!!

$$ \hat{y} = -0.372 + 0.212 \, \hat{x} $$

What do you expect the chirp rate will be if temperature is 100?

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

ggplot(data = crickets, aes(x = temp_F, y = chirps_in_15s)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

## Interpreting the slope

$$ \hat{y} = -0.372 + 0.212 \, \hat{x} $$

Slope of $0.212$ means that for every increase of 1 degree (F), the chirp rate will increase by 0.212.

## Outliers

Each data set has at least one outlier. How do the outliers affect the slope of the regression line?
