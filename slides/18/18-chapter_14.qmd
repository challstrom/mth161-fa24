## Case Study: opportunity cost

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.red {
color: #B8001F;
}
```

Will a prompt about saving money for future purchases would lead
students to spend less?

-   $H_0$ [Null hypothesis]{.red} Reminding students that they can save
    money for later purchases will [not have any impact]{.red} on
    spending decisions.

-   $H_A$ [Alternatve hypothesis]{.red} Reminding students that they can
    save money for later purchases [will reduce]{.red} the chance they
    will continue w/ purchase.

## Alternative Alternatives

$H_A$ [Alternatve hypothesis]{.red} Reminding students that they can
save money for later purchases [will reduce]{.red} the chance they will
continue w/ purchase.

\

But why is this the alternative hypothesis? Couldn't we also imagine
that the prompt would [increase]{.red} the chance that students buy the
item?

-   Probably not
-   And that's not the research question!

## Danger of One-Sided Hypotheses

1.  Framing $H_A$ to match the data elevates risk of [Type I
    error]{.red}.
2.  Framing $H_A$ to match what we think elevates risk of [confirmation
    bias]{.red}

## Two-Sided Test

Research question: does administering blood thinning medication have an
impact on survival rate of patients that have undergone CPR?

-   $H_0$ [Null hypothesis]{.red} Blood thinners do not have an effect
    on survival rates.

-   $H_A$ [Alternatve hypothesis]{.red} Blood thinners do have an impact
    on survival rates.

## Data

![](images/table.png){width="100%"}

Difference in proportions: 
$$
\hat{p_T} - \hat{p_C} = \frac{14}{40} - \frac{11}{50} =  0.13
$$

## Randomized null distribution

![](images/graph1.png){width="80%"} Observations that are at least as
large as 0.13

## Randomized null distribution

![](images/graph2.png){width="80%"} Observations that are at least as
[extreme]{.red} as $\pm 0.13$, in either direction!

## Two-sided tests

### p-value for two-sided test

First find p-value for one tail and then double it!

\

### Default to two-sided test

Only use a one-sided hypothesis test if you have a reason to focus on one direction in the alternative
