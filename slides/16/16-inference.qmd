### Central Limit Theorem

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.red {
  color: #B8001F;
}
```

The distribution of the sample statistic is [normal]{.red} if certain conditions are met.

::: task
1.  What do we mean by the distribution of the sample statistic?
2.  What conditions need to be met?
:::

## Sample distribution

> Example: In a sample of 224 ring-tailed lemurs, the average weight was 924 grams.

-   We expect the *sample statistic* to approximate the *population parameter*

-   But if you looked at a *different sample* you would not expect to get the same number!

## Sample distribution

-   take *another* sample of size $n$ (original sample size) from the population
-   calculate and record the sample statistic for this new sample
-   repeat this hundreds (thousands?) of times
-   not at all practical!

## Instead...

-   Either use simulation (randomization, bootstrapping, etc!)

-   Or use mathematical theory to know what to expect if we *had* taken repeated samples (central limit theorem)

## Conditions required by CLT

1.  [Independent observations]{.red}

-   Guaranteed when we take a random sample.

2.  [Large enough sample]{.red}

-   What qualifies as "large enough" differs by context (i.e., from sample statistic to sample statistic).

-   E.g. for proportions, need at least 10 expected successes and 10 expected failures.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(openintro)
library(latex2exp)
```

## Use the normal distribution...

\

### To make decisions -- [hypothesis testing]{.red}

-   determine the probability of the observed sample statistic (or something more extreme, in the direction of the alternative hypothesis), i.e. the [p-value]{.red}

## Use the normal distribution...

\

### To make estimations -- [confidence intervals]{.red}

-   calculate the bounds of the confidence interval, adding and subtracting a [margin of error]{.red} to the observed sample statistic

## Empirical Rule

The normal distribution is not just *any* unimodal and symmetric distribution, it follows the **68-95-99.7 rule**.

> The mean height of female identifying adults in the U.S. is 64.5'' with a standard deviation of 2.5''.

> Based on the empirical rule, about 95% of the adult female population is in what range of heights?

## Standard Error

-   The [center]{.red} of the sampling distribution will be at the true population parameter.

-   The **spread** of the sampling distribution is measured by the [standard error]{.red} (like the spread of a single sample is measured by the standard deviation)

## Standard Error Formulas

Each sample statistic has own formula for standard error

-   $\bar{x}$ -- sample mean
-   $\hat{p}$ -- sample proportion
-   $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2$ -- difference of sample means
-   $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ -- difference of sample proportions

We'll see these in later chapters...

## Margin of Error

-   Measures how far away observations are from population parameter.
-   Closely related to standard error: e.g. 95% of observations are within 2 SE of the mean.
