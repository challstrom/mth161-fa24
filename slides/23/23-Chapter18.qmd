## Two-Way Tables

In Chapters 16 and 17, we looked at [proportions]{.red} measured across
[two groups]{.red} - i.e. success and failure

Now, consider variables that have more than two possible options. This
means that there is not a single population parameter to look at.

## Example: selling used iPad

-   Seller has a used iPad that is known to have a potential issue (e.g
    it crashes occasionally)

-   Buyer provides a prompt: "I'm interested in buying this iPad..."

    -   [General:]{.red} ... what can you tell me about it?
    -   [Positive Assumption:]{.red} ... it doesn't have any problems, does
        it?
    -   [Negative Assumption:]{.red} ... what problems does it have?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In response to buyer's prompt, seller either [discloses]{.red} the known
issue or [does not]{.red}.

Is there evidence that there the different prompts lead to a difference
in disclosure rate?

Is the buyer's question [independent]{.red} of whether the seller
disclosed the problem?

## Expected Counts

To help us answer this question, we look at [expected counts.]{.red}

If the questions had no impact on what the seller disclosed, we should
be able to just look at [total]{.red} number of disclosures out of the
[total]{.red} number of cases.

$$
\frac{61}{219} = 0.2785
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then, using this disclosure rate, what would be the [expected]{.red} number of
counts in each group?

$$
73 ( 0.2785) = 20.33
$$

$$
73 (1-0.2785) = 52.67
$$

:::{.fragment}
What sound does the "ch" make in the word [Christmas]{.red}?

Why is that?
:::

## Chi-squared

For [each group]{.red} we now calculate $$
\frac{( \mbox{observed count} - \mbox{expected count})^2}{\mbox{expected count}}
$$ and [add]{.red} them together. This is called the [chi-squared]{.red}
test statistic $\chi^2$.

$$
\chi^2 = \sum\frac{( \mbox{observed count} - \mbox{expected count})^2}{\mbox{expected count}}
$$

## Conditions

-   Observations are independent
-   Sample size is large enough 
    - at least 5 expected counts in each
    group

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](images/ipad_expected.png){width="100%"}

\begin{multline}
\chi^2 = \frac{(2 - 20.33)^2}{20.33} + \frac{(23-20.33)^2}{20.33}+ \ldots \\
+ 
\frac{(37-52.67)^2}{52.67} 
\end{multline}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Did you get $\chi^2 = 40.13$?

\

:::{.fragment}
Is this value unusual?
:::

:::{.fragment}
To decide we look at the [chi-squared distribution]{.red} -- same idea as with normal distribution, but different shape.
:::

:::{.fragment}
Use technology (or a table)
:::

::: fragment
The exact shape is determined by the [degree of freedom]{.red} of our
two-way table.
:::

## Degree of Freedom

$$
df = (\mbox{\# of rows} - 1) \times (\mbox{\# of columns} - 1)
$$

In our example, 
$$
df = (R - 1)\times (C-1) = 2*1 = 2
$$


------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
curve(dchisq(x, df = 2), from =0, to = 30)
```

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

1 - pchisq(40.13, df = 2)
```

## Conclusion

This p-value is very very small! $$
\mbox{p-value} = 0.000000000193
$$ Much smaller than our discernment level $\alpha = 0.05$. We have
evidence to [reject]{.red} the null hypothesis.

:::{.fragment}
The data provides convincing evidence that the question asked
[did]{.red} affect a sellerâ€™s likelihood to tell the truth about
problems with the iPad.
:::

## Chi-squared distribution

The larger the degree of freedom, the longer the right tail extends. The
smaller the degrees of freedom, the more peaked the mode on the left
becomes.

## Tools to calculate p-value from a $\chi^2$ distribution

-   [Use Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qqyht18fxn)

-   Use R

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

1 - pchisq(40.13, df = 2)
```

-   Use tables

```{css, echo = FALSE}
.red {
color: #B8001F;
}
```
