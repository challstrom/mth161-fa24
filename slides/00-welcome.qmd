No specific points allocated to attendance, but attendance will be recorded periodically throughout the semester, and this information will be used as “extra credit” if you’re in between two grades and a minor bump would help.

See [course syllabus](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-syllabus.html) for how the final letter grade will be determined.

## Support

-   Attend office hours
-   Ask and answer questions on the discussion forum

-   Read the [course support](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-support.html) page

## Announcements

-   Posted on Canvas (Announcements tool) and sent via email, be sure to check both regularly
-   I'll assume that you've read an announcement by the next "business" day
-   I'll (try my best to) send a weekly update announcement each Friday, outlining the plan for the following week and reminding you what you need to do to prepare, practice, and perform

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

::: incremental
-   Please let me know your preferred name and pronouns on the Getting to know you survey.
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisors, and deans are excellent resources.
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
:::

## Accessibility

-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.

-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better. If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.

# Course policies

## Late work, waivers, regrades policy

-   We have policies!
-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-syllabus.html) and refer back to them when you need it
