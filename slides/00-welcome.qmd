## I invite you to...

### think about how we use data to understand the world


# Introductions

In groups of 3-4:

-   Introduce yourselves - name, pronouns, hometown, major, interests

-   Find one thing that you all have in common


Report to the class - everyone introduce someone else from the group.

## Still in your groups... {.center}

### ... for each of the following questions

\

1\. Think on your own about how you might answer (1 min)

2\. Discuss with your group your responses (5-8 min)

3\. Share out to the class one idea or thought (5 min)

## What are the goals of a college education? {.center}

## How does a person learn something new? {.center}

## What do you expect to remember from your classes 10 years from now? {.center}

## What is the value of making mistakes? {.center}

## How can we create an environment where risk taking is encouraged and productive failure is valued? {.center}

## Penguins
